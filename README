I worked with Saurabh for this assignment. On my machine, I began setting up the environment for assignment 02. I started building the kernel and encountered which i solved by installing all the dependencies. Then I edited the cpuid.c and added if..else condition in the kvm_emulate_cpuid block code. I encountered the error of undefined variable when I use U32 therefore I reinitialized it by using atomic variables After Saurabh committed the changes he made to vmx.c, I rebuilt the kernel and committed it to the GitHub repo inside /arch/x86/kvm after a successful built. I also installed KVM on the hypervisor so that a guest VM can be created and test script can be executed on that.
